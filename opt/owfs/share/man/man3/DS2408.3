.SH FAMILY CODE
.PP
.I 29
.SH SPECIAL PROPERTIES
.SS latch.0 ... latch.7 latch.ALL latch.BYTE
.I read-write, binary
.br
The 8 pins (PIO) latch a bit when their state changes, either externally, or through a write to the pin. 
.br
Reading the
.I latch
property indicates that the latch has been set.
.br
Writing "true" (non-zero) to ANY 
.I latch 
will reset them all. (This is the hardware design).
.br
.I ALL
is all 
.I latch 
states, accessed simultaneously, comma separated.
.br
.I BYTE
references all channels simultaneously as a single byte. Channel 0 is bit 0.
.SS PIO.0 ...  PIO.7 PIO.ALL PIO.BYTE
.I read-write, yes-no
.br
State of the open-drain output (
.I PIO
) pin. 0 = non-conducting (off), 1 = conducting (on).
.br
Writing zero will turn off the switch, non-zero will turn on the switch. Reading the
.I PIO
state will return the switch setting. To determine the actual logic level at the switch, refer to the
.I sensed.0 ... sensed.7 sensed.ALL sensed.BYTE
property.
.br
.I ALL
references all channels simultaneously, comma separated.
.br
.I BYTE
references all channels simultaneously as a single byte. Channel 0 is bit 0.
.SS power
.I read-only, yes-no
.br
Is the
.I DS2408
powered parasitically (0) or separately on the Vcc pin (1)?
.SS sensed.0 ... sensed.7 sensed.ALL
.I read-only, yes-no
.br
Logic level at the
.I PIO
pin. 0 = ground. 1 = high (~2.4V - 5V ). Really makes sense only if the
.I PIO
state is set to zero (off), else will read zero.
.br
.I ALL
references all channels simultaneously, comma separated.
.br
.I BYTE
references all channels simultaneously as a single byte. Channel 0 is bit 0.
.SS strobe
.I read-write, yes-no
.br
RSTZ Pin Mode Control. Configures RSTZ as either RST input or STRB output:
.TP
.I 0
configured as RST input (default)
.TP
.I 1
configured as STRB output
.PP
.SS por
.I read-write, yes-no
.br
Specifies whether the device has performed power-on reset. This bit can only
be cleared to 0 under software control. As long as this bit is 1 the device
will always respond to a conditional search.
.SS out_of_testmode
.I write-only, yes-no
.br
Write "1" to this property to make sure the device has been properly initialized on startup.
.PP
The datasheet says that under some conditions the startup (power-up) will leave the device in the "testmode" state. Any problems with "Channel Access Write" will trigger this property automaticlly, but this property makes explicit initialization possible as well.
.SS set_alarm
.I read-write, integer unsigned (0-333333333)
.br
A number consisting of 9 digits XYYYYYYYY, where:
.TP
X
select source and logical term 
.br 
.I 0
PIO   OR 
.br 
.I 1
latch OR 
.br 
.I 2
PIO   AND 
.br 
.I 3
latch AND
.TP
Y
select channel and polarity
.br 
.I 0
Unselected (LOW) 
.br
.I 1
Unselected (HIGH) 
.br
.I 2
Selected    LOW 
.br
.I 3
Selected    HIGH
.PP
All digits will be truncated to the 0-3 range. Leading zeroes are optional. Low-order digit is channel 0.
.PP
Example:
.TP
100000033
Responds on Conditional Search when latch.1 or latch.0 are set to 1.
.TP
222000000
Responds on Conditional Search when sensed.7 and sensed.6 are set to 0.
.TP
000000000 (0)
Never responds to Conditional Search.

.SS 1-Wire
.I 1-wire 
is a wiring protocol and series of devices designed and manufactured
by Dallas Semiconductor, Inc. The bus is a low-power low-speed low-connector
scheme where the data line can also provide power.
.PP
Each device is uniquely and unalterably numbered during manufacture. There are a wide variety
of devices, including memory, sensors (humidity, temperature, voltage,
contact, current), switches, timers and data loggers. More complex devices (like
thermocouple sensors) can be built with these basic devices. There are also
1-wire devices that have encryption included.
.PP
The 1-wire scheme uses a single 
.I bus master
and multiple
.I slaves
on the same wire. The bus master initiates all communication. The slaves can be 
individually discovered and addressed using their unique ID.
.PP
Bus masters come in a variety of configurations including serial, parallel, i2c, network or USB
adapters.
.SS OWFS design
.I OWFS
is a suite of programs that designed to make the 1-wire bus and its
devices easily accessible. The underlying principle is to create a virtual
filesystem, with the unique ID being the directory, and the individual
properties of the device are represented as simple files that can be read and written.
.PP 
Details of the individual slave or master design are hidden behind a consistent interface. The goal is to 
provide an easy set of tools for a software designer to create monitoring or control applications. There 
are some performance enhancements in the implementation, including data caching, parallel access to bus 
masters, and aggregation of device communication. Still the fundamental goal has been ease of use, flexibility
and correctness rather than speed.
.SS DS2408
The
.B DS2408 (3)
allows control of other devices, like LEDs and relays. It extends the
.B DS2406
to 8 channels and includes memory.
.br
Alternative switches include the
.B DS2406, DS2407
and even
.B DS2450

All 1-wire devices are factory assigned a unique 64-bit address. This address is of the form:
.TP
.B Family Code
8 bits
.TP
.B Address
48 bits
.TP
.B CRC
8 bits
.IP
.PP
Addressing under OWFS is in hexadecimal, of form:
.IP
.B 01.123456789ABC
.PP
where
.B 01
is an example 8-bit family code, and
.B 12345678ABC
is an example 48 bit address.
.PP
The dot is optional, and the CRC code can included. If included, it must be correct.
