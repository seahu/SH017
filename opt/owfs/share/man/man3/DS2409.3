.SH SPECIAL PROPERTIES
.SS aux
.I directory
.br
This is the
.I aux
branch of the
.I DS2409
network branch. It is implicitly accessed (via the
.I aux smart-on
command) when it is listed or devices on this branch are addressed.
.SS branch.0 branch.1 branch.ALL branch.BYTE
.I read-write, yes-no
.br
Writing a value of
.I 1
to the branch properties explicitly selects the meant branch (
.I 0=main
or
.I 1=aux
). Writing 
.I 0
deselects the branch.
This is an addition to the directory branch selection scheme available by simply accessing the
.I main
and
.I aux
directories. Both ways to select a branch coexist nicely but the latest scheme used wins.
Attempting to select both branches, either by setting both bits at the same time or subsequently, fails.
Clearing both branch selection bits, either by clearing both bits at the same time or subsequently,
resets the event flags inside the
.I DS2409
as a side effect.
Reading the branch properties returns which branch (if any) is connected to the master bus.
.P
.B After using the directory branch selection scheme, both branches are deselected automatically.
.P
.I ALL
is an aggregate of the properties, comma separated. It is an atomic operation.
.br
.I BYTE
is an aggregate of the branches as a byte,
.I main
is bit 0. It is an atomic operation.
.SS control
.I read-write, unsigned integer
.br
Setting of the PIO
.I control
pin. There are 4 possible settings:
.TP
.B 0
Unconditionally off (non-conducting)
.TP
.B 1
Unconditionally on (conducting)
.TP
.B 2
Auto on when
.I main
branch switched in
.TP
.B 3
Auto on when
.I aux
branch switched in
.SS discharge
.I write-only, yes-no
.br
Writing a non-zero value to this property will electrically reset both the main and auxiliary branches of the 1-wire bus by dropping power for 100 milliseconds. All devices on those branches will lose parasitic power and reset to power-up defaults. As a side effect, both
.I event
flags and thus, the alarm state, are cleared, too.
.SS event.0 event.1 event.ALL event.BYTE
.I read-only, yes-no
.br
Has the
.I event
flag for the branch been triggered? A negative edge on the disconnected branch (
.I 0=main
or
.I 1=aux
) sets the flag. This is achieved by e.g. connecting an iButton to the branch. Value returned is 1 (yes) or 0 (no).
.P
After accessing the 
.I main
or
.I aux
directory, both branches are deselected automatically and thus, the event flags and alarm state are cleared.
.P
.I ALL
is an aggregate of the properties, comma separated. It is an atomic operation.
.br
.I BYTE
is an aggregate of the branches as a byte,
.I main
is bit 0. It is an atomic operation.
.SS clearevent
.I write-only, yes-no
.br
Writing a non-zero value to this property will reset both
.I event
flags and thus, clear the alarm state, too.
.br
.SS main
.I directory
.br
This is the
.I main
branch of the
.I DS2409
network branch. It is implicitly accessed (via the
.I main smart-on
command) when it is listed or devices on this branch are addressed.
.SS sensed.0 sensed.1 sensed.ALL sensed.BYTE
.I read-only, yes-no
.br
Voltage sensed at the
.I 0=main
or
.I 1=aux
branch pin. Valid only when the branch is switched out. Value returned is 0 (low) or 1 (high).
.P
.I ALL
is an aggregate of the properties, comma separated. It is an atomic operation.
.br
.I BYTE
is an aggregate of the branches as a byte,
.I main
is bit 0. It is an atomic operation.

.SS address
.SS r_address
.I read-only, ascii
.br
The entire 64-bit unique ID. Given as upper case hexadecimal digits (0-9A-F).
.br
.I address
starts with the
.I family
code
.br
.I r address
is the
.I address
in reverse order, which is often used in other applications and labeling.
.SS crc8
.I read-only, ascii
.br
The 8-bit error correction portion. Uses cyclic redundancy check. Computed from the preceding 56 bits of the unique ID number. Given as upper case hexadecimal digits (0-9A-F).
.SS family
.I read-only, ascii
.br
The 8-bit family code. Unique to each
.I type
of device. Given as upper case hexadecimal digits (0-9A-F).
.SS id
.SS r_id
.I read-only, ascii
.br
The 48-bit middle portion of the unique ID number. Does not include the family code or CRC. Given as upper case hexadecimal digits (0-9A-F).
.br
.I r id
is the
.I id
in reverse order, which is often used in other applications and labeling.
.SS locator
.SS r_locator
.I read-only, ascii
.br
Uses an extension of the 1-wire design from iButtonLink company that associated 1-wire physical connections with a unique 1-wire code. If the connection is behind a
.B Link Locator
the
.I locator will show a unique 8-byte number (16 character hexadecimal) starting with family code FE.
.br
If no
.B Link Locator
is between the device and the master, the
.I locator
field will be all FF.
.br
.I r locator
is the
.I locator

.SS present (DEPRECATED)
.I read-only, yes-no
.br
Is the device currently
.I present
on the 1-wire bus?
.SS type
.I read-only, ascii
.br
Part name assigned by Dallas Semi. E.g.
.I DS2401
Alternative packaging (iButton vs chip) will not be distiguished.
.SH ALARMS

.I DS2409

.I main

.SS 1-Wire
.I 1-wire 
is a wiring protocol and series of devices designed and manufactured
by Dallas Semiconductor, Inc. The bus is a low-power low-speed low-connector
scheme where the data line can also provide power.
.PP
Each device is uniquely and unalterably numbered during manufacture. There are a wide variety
of devices, including memory, sensors (humidity, temperature, voltage,
contact, current), switches, timers and data loggers. More complex devices (like
thermocouple sensors) can be built with these basic devices. There are also
1-wire devices that have encryption included.
.PP
The 1-wire scheme uses a single 
.I bus master
and multiple
.I slaves
on the same wire. The bus master initiates all communication. The slaves can be 
individually discovered and addressed using their unique ID.
.PP
Bus masters come in a variety of configurations including serial, parallel, i2c, network or USB
adapters.
.SS OWFS design
.I OWFS
is a suite of programs that designed to make the 1-wire bus and its
devices easily accessible. The underlying principle is to create a virtual
filesystem, with the unique ID being the directory, and the individual
properties of the device are represented as simple files that can be read and written.
.PP 
Details of the individual slave or master design are hidden behind a consistent interface. The goal is to 
provide an easy set of tools for a software designer to create monitoring or control applications. There 
are some performance enhancements in the implementation, including data caching, parallel access to bus 
masters, and aggregation of device communication. Still the fundamental goal has been ease of use, flexibility
and correctness rather than speed.
.SS DS2409
The
.B DS2409 (3)
allows complex 1-wire network topology. Each branch has it's power preserved, even when isolated from the master. A separate PIO pin can be configured to show branch switching, or controlled explicitly.

All 1-wire devices are factory assigned a unique 64-bit address. This address is of the form:
.TP
.B Family Code
8 bits
.TP
.B Address
48 bits
.TP
.B CRC
8 bits
.IP
.PP
Addressing under OWFS is in hexadecimal, of form:
.IP
.B 01.123456789ABC
.PP
where
.B 01
is an example 8-bit family code, and
.B 12345678ABC
is an example 48 bit address.
.PP
The dot is optional, and the CRC code can included. If included, it must be correct.
